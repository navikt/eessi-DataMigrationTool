In general, every version of DMT released publicly depends on a specific version of RINA. 
The version of RINA on which a certain release of DMT depends on can be found in the pom.xml, in the following property:
<!-- EESSI -->
<eessi.rina.version>X.Y.Z</eessi.rina.version>

1. Building RINA sources
In order to build DMT, you need to build first the corresponding RINA sources.
For DMT v.2.1.2, the correspong RINA version is RINA 6.2.5

2. Building DMT
DMT can be built by running the following command:
mvn clean install -DskipTests

Note: Some of the unit tests fail by default. They need special configuration. For this reason, all the mvn build commands use the -DskipTests flag (this means building without running unit tests).
